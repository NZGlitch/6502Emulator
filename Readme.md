### MOS 6052 CPU Emulator by NZGlitch

This is a 'pet' project to implement a fully working MOS 6502 Emulator. 
I've always been interested in learning C++ and have a keen interest in
retro computing so this seemed like a good idea.

## *** WORK IN PROGRESS ***

**TODO's** (In no particular order)
 - Implement instructions: 
   - CMP, CPX, CPY, SBC, BRK, RTI
 - Write tests for BaseInstruction class
 - Refactor older instructions to match new architecture
    - JUMP, LOAD, SHIFT, STACK, STORE, TRANSFER
 - reset, irq, nmi functions
 - Interrupt/rest vectors $FFFA - $FFFF
 - Cleanup gtest warnings on compile
 - Make command line executable that runs a binary file
 - Licence & copyright
---

### Getting Started

The emulator is not yet ready to run as a stand alone application as there are still
instructions to implement. You can run the Test suite and execute a test program - 
see [E6502Test/src/test_program.cpp](E6502Test/src/test_program.cpp) for an example.

**Acknowledgements**

Special thanks to Dave Poo and his video series on his implementation of the 6502. 
While my approach is quite different, Dave's videos got me onto a good start -
you can see them on his Youtube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/@DavePoo

Also a super shout out to [Klaus2m5](https://www.github.com/klaus2m5) for his amazing
functional test suites.
